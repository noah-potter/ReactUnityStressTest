### About this project

This is an example of elements not being rendered. The app is supposed to render a green grid, but often, a random amount of tiles aren't rendered on the first render.

### Expected output

![](/expected_output.png)

### Example actual output

![](/actual_output.png)

### Previous test

`pyramid.webm` is another example of a previous test I was running that shows the initial squares not rendering. I figured the grid shows it better.
